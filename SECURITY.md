# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and procedures for the Insurance Claims Processing System.

## Authentication Mechanisms

### User Authentication
- Token-based authentication using Django REST framework
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Multi-factor authentication support for admin users

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Hierarchical role system:
  - Super Admin
  - Admin
  - AI Engineer
  - Claims Processor
  - Customer
- Fine-grained permissions for each role
- Permission inheritance and delegation

## Data Encryption

### Data at Rest
- Database encryption using PostgreSQL's pgcrypto
- File encryption for sensitive documents
- Encrypted backups
- Secure key management

### Data in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Encrypted API communications

### Sensitive Data Handling
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) encryption
- Medical record encryption
- Secure storage of financial information
- Data anonymization for ML training
